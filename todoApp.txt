In Training we have:
- Importing dataset: Here we are importing from a csv file.
- Doing Feature Engineering:  Removing high cardinallity features. 
- Separate data: Separate data into feature and target values and into training and testing.
- Model: Selecting from different types of model that can be suitable for the task or to a custom model provided in config.
- Evaluation: Metrics  in classification (accuracy, Roc-Auc,precision, recall, f1_score) and Metrics in Regression (MAE, MSQRT).
- Generate model: Generate a pickle model.
- It would be nice to have a ML-Flow attach to it just to save metrics
- TODO: Nice to have feature importance.  
- TODO: treating missing and balancing data.
- TODO: Testing 

In Model Serving we have:
- Take models from previous step.
- Instanciate a web server. And join the needed files to config.
- TODO: In some cases we would need to perform feature engineering in training and so in prediction data.
- TODO: Create a cache database to save same predictions.
- TODO: It would be nice to have a Elastic Cache to save application log and see it usage.
